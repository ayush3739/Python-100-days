## ✅ Basic Structure of a Commit Message

```txt
<type>: <short summary of what you did>
```

> Keep it in **present tense** and **short**, like you're saying “This commit does X.”

## 🧠 Common Commit Message Types

| Type       | Use this when you...                          | Example                                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | add a **new feature / file**                  | `feat: add Day 15 test.py`                       |
| `fix`      | fix a **bug or error**                        | `fix: correct score logic in higher_or_lower.py` |
| `refactor` | clean up code **without changing output**     | `refactor: simplify loop in Day 14 script`       |
| `style`    | change formatting (tabs, spacing, comments)   | `style: format print statements in test.py`      |
| `docs`     | update or add **documentation** (README, etc) | `docs: update README with Day 14 progress`       |
| `chore`    | small tasks like renaming files, cleanup      | `chore: rename Day14 to Day_14`                  |

## 📝 Pro Tip: Use Meaningful Messages

Bad:

```txt
update
changed stuff
fixed it
```

Good:

```txt
fix: correct input validation in Day 13 project
feat: add calculator project for Day 10
```

## ✍️ Practice

Try writing the right commit message for these actions:

1. You added a new Python file `day17_guess.py` →
   ✍️ `feat: add Day 17 number guessing game`

2. You changed the print format in Day 14 →
   ✍️ `style: update print format in Day 14`

3. You deleted some unused variables →
   ✍️ `chore: remove unused variables in higher_or_lower.py`
