# Pong Game

A classic Pong game implementation using Python's Turtle graphics with two-player paddle controls.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay with keyboard controls
- Ball physics with paddle and wall bouncing
- Score tracking for both players
- Continuous ball movement and collision detection
- Classic arcade-style visual design

## Controls
- **Right Paddle**: Up/Down arrow keys
- **Left Paddle**: W/S keys (typically)

## Game Components
- `main.py` - Main game loop and setup
- `paddle.py` - Paddle class with movement controls
- `ball.py` - Ball class with physics and collision
- `scoreboard.py` - Score tracking and display

## How to Play
1. Run `main.py`
2. Each player controls their paddle to hit the ball
3. Score points when opponent misses the ball
4. First to reach target score wins

## Learning Concepts
- Object-oriented programming
- Game physics and collision detection
- Event handling and keyboard input
- Turtle graphics animation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- turtle module (included with Python)
