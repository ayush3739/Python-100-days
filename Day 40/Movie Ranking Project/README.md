# 🎬 Movie Ranking Website Project

A hands-on HTML project to practice heading hierarchy, paragraph elements, and void elements by creating your personal movie ranking webpage.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project challenges you to create a personal movie ranking website that showcases your favorite movies using proper HTML structure. It integrates headings, paragraphs, and void elements in a real-world context, allowing you to apply all the fundamental HTML concepts you've learned.

## 📁 Project Files

- **`goal.png`** - Visual target showing the expected layout and design
- **`index.html`** - Your starting template (customize this file)
- **`solution.html`** - Complete solution for reference

## 🎯 Project Requirements

Your movie ranking page should include:

1. **Main heading** (`<h1>`) - Your personal movie ranking title
2. **Subheading** (`<h2>`) - Description of your list (e.g., "My top 3 movies of all-time")
3. **Horizontal rule** (`<hr />`) - Visual separator between header and content
4. **Movie sections** - Each movie should have:
   - Movie title as `<h3>` heading
   - Description paragraph (`<p>`) with your thoughts and review
   - Line breaks (`<br />`) where appropriate for formatting

## 💻 Example Structure

```html
<h1>Top Movies of All Time According to [Your Name]</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Movie Title 1</h3>
<p>Your thoughts about this movie.<br />
What makes it special to you and why you love it.</p>

<h3>Movie Title 2</h3>
<p>Description of why you love this movie.<br />
Share your personal connection or favorite scenes.</p>

<h3>Movie Title 3</h3>
<p>Your review and personal connection to this film.<br />
What impact did it have on you?</p>
```

## 🏆 Skills You'll Practice

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Choose meaningful movies** - Pick films you genuinely enjoy and can write about
2. **Write authentic reviews** - Share your personal thoughts, feelings, and experiences
3. **Use proper hierarchy** - Follow the h1 → h2 → h3 structure consistently
4. **Keep it concise** - Aim for 2-3 sentences per movie description
5. **Check your structure** - Compare your result with the goal image
6. **Be personal** - This is YOUR ranking, so make it reflect your taste!

## 🎯 Challenge Extensions

Once you complete the basic project, try these enhancements:

### Beginner Extensions
- Add more movies to your list (top 5 or top 10)

- Add genre information for each movie

### Intermediate Extensions
- Create themed lists (e.g., "Best Sci-Fi Movies", "Favorite Animated Films")
- Write longer, more detailed reviews with specific scenes you loved

- Create multiple ranking categories (by genre, by decade, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Open `index.html`** in your code editor
2. **View `goal.png`** to see what you're aiming to create
3. **Start coding** - Replace the placeholder content with your own movies
4. **Test in browser** - Open your HTML file to see how it looks
5. **Compare with solution** - Check `solution.html` if you need guidance
