## Purpose and Hierarchy of Heading Elements

The purpose of heading elements comes from book binding. When you create a book and a table of contents, there is a hierarchy: top-level headings (Level 1), Level 2 headings for related sections, and even subsections (such as 8.1) for more detail. In HTML, these correspond to h1, h2, h3, and so on. There are six levels of headings in HTML, from h1 to h6. There is no h7 tag. Once you reach h6, anything lower in importance should use a different type of tag.

### Example HTML Structure

```html
<h1>Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<h3>Section 1</h3>
<h3>Section 2</h3>
<h4>Diagram 1</h4>
```

## Best Practices for Heading Elements

- Use only one h1 element per page, as it represents the top-level heading (like a book title).
- For subtitles or lower-level headings, use h2, h3, and so on, up to h6.
- Do not skip heading levels; for example, do not go from h1 directly to h3. If you use h3, there should be an h2 somewhere on the page.
- These rules are conventions for professionalism and accessibility, not strict requirements. Your website will still function if you break them, but following them is best practice.
